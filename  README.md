# Requirements
- Node

## How to make it work 
1. npm i
2. npx cypress open
3. run the spec

## Cypress
Test files are under cypress/e2e/search folder.
Custome commands created are under cypress/support/commands.js

## Improvements that could be made (but out of scope for this challenge)
- Using cypress fixtures to test a data set
- Consideting the multiple possiblities on the results page when it comes to the different results sections (maps, frequent questions, images, links to twitter,...) that make the testing unstable.
